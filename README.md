### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, each lab prepared me for this assignment, especially lab 3 "GIPHY PARTY" on API. However, I felt unprepared for creating the pop-up feature and other stretch features. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would've liked to expand on my search method so that it would an option to filter results through rating, year released, and average vote. I also wished I could've gotten the popup 
display feature to work. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I saw some peers making their websites more interactive via highlighting movies where a mouse hovered and increasing the size. 

### Open-source libraries used

I did not use any open source libraries for this assignment. 

### Shout out
I'd like to shoutout Samara and Rodrigo since they were super nice and helpful. They helped me throughout the assignment and didn't make me feel bad for not understanding something.
I would also like to shoutout Paige for staying with my group to make sure our bugs were fixed and spending time walking us through our through process.
